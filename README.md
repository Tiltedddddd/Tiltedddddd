## What I'm About

I have a strong belief that all websites need to look good before anything.
I love learning beyond the classroom. Whether it's building a Telegram bot to filter stock news, making my girlfriend a cuter product stocktake website, or creating a mall directory from scratch â€” I find joy in creating useful, user-friendly things with great UI/UX.

- ðŸ’» Projects: [StockScoop](https://github.com/Tiltedddddd/stockScoop), [SingSplore](https://github.com/Tiltedddddd/SingSplore), [IkaStockCheck](https://github.com/Tiltedddddd/ikaStockCheck)
- I'm a creative thinker who loves ideating and developing 
- I enjoy and I'm constantly learning my next step will be stepping deeper into writing clean code and exploring backend dev
